### [Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/use-dot-notation-to-access-the-properties-of-an-object)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
The following code will simply print `1` from the `obj` object.
```js
let obj = {
  property1: 1,
  property2: 2
};
console.log(obj.property1);
```
Following this logic, use the `console.log` operation to print both `property1` and `property2` to the screen.
